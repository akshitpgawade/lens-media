    name: "Agency Framing",
    body: "We score sentences on active vs. passive/agentless construction. 'Police shoot man' assigns clear agency; 'Man dies in police encounter' obscures it. A low score means agency is often removed from actors; a high score means actors are named. This is descriptive linguistics, not an ethics claim.",

    n: "03",
    name: "Language Intensity",
    body: "Three sub-scores measure emotional load (charged adjectives), certainty (hedging vs. absolute claims), and urgency (present-tense, imperative, and time-pressure vocabulary). Higher isn't 'worse' — human-interest reporting is often high-emotion by design.",

    n: "04",
    name: "Perspective Coverage Matrix",

          These signals are inspired by decades of media framing scholarship — including
          Herman &amp; Chomsky's <em>Propaganda Model</em>, Entman's framing theory, and
          journalism ethics on sourcing and agency. We treat these frameworks as
          <strong> interpretive lenses</strong>, not as the truth about any specific article.

          The metrics you see are aids for thinking, not machine verdicts. Two thoughtful
          readers can look at the same Source Attribution Ratio and reasonably disagree
          about what it means.
